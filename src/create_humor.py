#TODO Idea 1
# 1. Get Context Sentence from Domain 1 (GPT-2)
# 2. Find "pivot sentence" that is plausible from both domain 1 and domain 2 (maybe a 50/50 mix from both domains)
# 3. Use XLNet to fill in the sentence with different masks to go between domain 1 and domain 2
# 4. Generate text after pivot using domain 2 (GPT-2)
# Note we can potentially not show the original domain sentence to the end user

# TODO Idea 2:
# 1. Find a word with multiple senses
# 2. Generate sentence from domain 1 (GPT-2) that uses that word
# 3. Find another word from domain 2 that is related to the word (maybe using word vectors???)
# 4. Generate sentence using that related word in domain 2.
